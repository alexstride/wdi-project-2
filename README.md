### Description

The brief of this short project was to build a full REST application with several models being stored in a mongo database. 

I created a McDonald's restaurant review app, where likeminded McDonald's enthusiasts can meet to share their thoughts and experiences.

The site is structured by restaurant, allowing users to create new restaurants, submit reviews for restaurants and comment on eachother's reviews.

Users are able to create and manage their own account, with many of the features of the site only being visible to authenticated users.

### Technologies used

The list of the languages, frameworks, lib used in the project:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (SASS)
- Bulma
- JavaScript (ES6)
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Express.js
- ejs
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- bcrypt
- Gulp
- Yarn
- Git
- Github
- Heroku

### Challenges faced

This being my first full-stack application, the main challenges were around working out how to requests and responses in Express, using models with Mongoose and using session cookies to implement user authentication.

Another area of difficulty was working with a CSS framework, while trying to give the site an individual feel, which involved digging deep into the framework to work out how to override some of the layout settings.

### Rounding it off

Improvements that I would like to make to the project in the future would be:

To improve the user-profile creation experience by allowing users to upload their own profile picture. 

To integrate Google Maps into the site, to allow stores to be placed on a map, and stores to be found by proximity.
